I've been thinking about something for a while, and I wanted to be honest about it. When I find out someone drinks or smokes, it changes how I think about them. I know it's not fair to judge, and I'm not trying to tell people what to do.


The thing is, I want people to thrive and reach their full potential. I think everyone's got something unique to offer. It's tough to see people doing things that might hold them back, because I know they can do better.

I'm not trying to be perfect or tell people what's right and wrong. I just want the people I care about, especially those close to me, to be happy and healthy. I know it's their choice, and I respect that. But when I see people doing things that might harm them, it makes me feel sad and worried.

I want people to know that I care about them, no matter what they do. Everyone's important to me, and I value our friendships. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel, and I hope people can understand where I'm coming from.
